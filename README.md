# Hey, i'm **Atal kumar**

And I'm from Haryana, India

I'm **19** years old and have a great interest in "Computers" right from my childhood, even though I just started by playing games but the tech facinated me,

and that's the reason when the time came for me to choose the field I wanna work in I chose the "CS" & done my *Bachelor's in Computer Application* (2022-2025) right after schooling,

The BCA's journey was quite something : learned alot about fundamentals, programming, computers and all the stuff! (The course was very outdated but helped in teaching the fundamentals, and I feel it was good for the foundation)

**Currently**, I'm working on C++ and Dev & learning new skills...

**Next step** : To do Master's in Computer Application
