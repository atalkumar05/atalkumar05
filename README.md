## About me

I'm **19 years old**, and I've had a great interest in **computers** since childhood.  
Sure, I started with gaming (who didn’t? 😆), but the tech behind it always fascinated me.

When it was time to pick a career path, I chose **Computer Science**, and pursued my  
**Bachelor's in Computer Application (2022–2025)** right after school.

## 🎓 My BCA Journey

BCA taught me a lot—fundamentals of programming, systems, and how things actually work.  
Yeah, the course was kinda outdated 👀, but it gave me a solid **foundation** I’m proud of.
